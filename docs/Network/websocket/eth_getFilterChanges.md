  - For filters created with eth_newBlockFilter the return are block
    hashes (32 Bytes), e.g. ["0x3454645634534..."].

    are transaction hashes (32 Bytes), e.g. ["0x6345343454645..."].
  - For filters created with eth_newFilter logs are objects with
    following params:
- `removed`: true when the log was removed, due to a chain
  reorganization. false if its a valid log.
- `logIndex`: integer of the log index position in the block. null when

- `transactionIndex`: integer of the transactions index position log was
  created from. null when its pending log.
- `transactionHash`: 32 Bytes - hash of the transactions this log was
  created from. null when its pending log.
- `blockHash`: 32 Bytes - hash of the block where this log was in. null
  when its pending. null when its pending log.
- `blockNumber`: the block number where this log was in. null when its
  pending. null when its pending log.
- `address`: 20 Bytes - address from which this log originated.
