## Generalized Workflows and Strategies

Sandwiching transactions _is_ one of our preferred methods to extract MEV value.

The general flow for our model will be accepting new transactions
through a front end on supported pairs. Users query their specific
transaction and we estimate a quote on how much it will cost them to
perform their transaction, along with a wait time. If the user chooses
to commit their transaction, they agree to a transaction to be performed
no worse than the quote by the timeout given; We then add the new
transaction request into our backend to be bundled.

#### Ideal Workflow

If we can find a bundle that is worth being minted before the
transactions timeout period, we will submit the bundle to the miners,
and then wait for the next block minted to acknowledge our bundle. If
our bundle is in the next block, we send an acknowledgement back to the
front end.

#### Ideal Success

If we cannot find a bundle that includes transaction T before their
timeout, we will report back to the front end, acknowledging that their
transaction has timed out.

## 'BLT' Sandwiching

Before flashbots, sandwich attacking involved finding a sequence of
transaction to be able to back run, meaning to put a desired transaction
behind a large transaction experiencing high slippage, to experience
positive slippage caused by the large transaction before hand. In our
case, we're working with a private transaction flow where we can
sequence them however we choose, meaning we can produce and capture MEV
opportunities that would typically be exploited by a third party. the
key to sandwiching with a reliable benefit to our users is to sequence
transaction flow such that the cost that each transaction would
experience is less than if they had all placed their orders
individually. Ideally we should look to sequence the opposite
transaction behind significant transactions in one direction to capture
this MEV potential.

## Miner bidding

A factor to be considered by our system for producing possible bundles
is to ask if the bundle is profitable enough to cover the bid require to
be minted, while still having left over value to redistribute to the
front end users, and the community as a whole. What a miner will accept
can be approximated by viewing the previous minted blocks transactions,
and looking at the bottom N transactions within that block. Those bottom
N transactions are the transactions with the cheapest gas prices that
were still minted into the block; in order to have our bundle minted
into a block, we must be able to beat or match the last N transactions
within a block's gas prices. If we assume that we will always sandwich 3
transactions together into 1 bundle, we can approximate that we must
beat whatever the last 3 transactions in the last minted blocks' gas
prices were.

Given minted transactions $$T={t_1,â€¦,t_k}$ in previous block, we know we
must provide a higher payout than $T_{min}=[t_{k-n},t_k]$, where $N$ is
the number of transactions within bundle $B$, and payouts are determined
by the gas price $t^g_n$ and gas limit $t^l_n$, we know our bid
$B_{bid}$ must be:

$B_{b i d}>=\sum_{n=0}^{B_{n}-1} t_{k-n}^{g} * t_{k-n}^{l}$

## Quote pricing

Giving a reasonable quote to the front end user will depend on that
inherent value of the transaction being posted in relation to what
transactions we currently have pending to be minted, namely its volume
of tokens being swapped.


## Fee estimation algorithm

Estimate gas based on historical data and set it as Gas_Limit <br>
Take a margin of L>1 and set Limit_used = Gas_Limit * L <br>
For each executed transaction(With Limit_Used), read the actual gas used: Gas_used <br>
If Gas_used > Gas_Limit, set Gas_Limit = Gas_used, Limit_used = Gas_used * L <br>
If a transaction fails for insufficient gas:
<br>

      Run estimateGas() on the failed transaction and obtain Failed_Limit <br>
      Create and sign a new transaction <br>
      Retransmit transaction with new estimation <br>
      Update Gas_Limit = Failed_Limit <br>
      Raise error for investigation <br>
