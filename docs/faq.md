## FAQ

### General and Common Questions

> I submitted a trade and never got any rebate back, why?

Your trade was not eligible for being included into a bundle, so we could not
generate an arbitrage opportunity from it.

> If a trade I submit is not included in a bundle, what benefit do I get form
> OpenMEV?

Your trades are sent to miners via our private and permissioned RPC connections.
This means you get transaction privacy no matter if your transaction is included
in a bundle or if its not.
