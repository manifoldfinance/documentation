Participant as provided herein and in Rule 601, Commodity Stream, LLC shall have the right:

    (i) With respect to Contracts in a Customer Account of such Commodity Stream, LLC Clearing
    Participant, to set off [x] any proceeds received by Commodity Stream, LLC from the disposition of

    as Margin for such account against [y] any amounts paid by Commodity Stream, LLC in the disposition
    of such Contracts,

    including any commissions or other losses or expenses incurred in connection therewith or

    (iii) To defer closing or otherwise settling such trades and Contracts if, in its
    discretion, it determines that the closing out of some or all of the suspended Clearing
    Participant’s trades or Contracts would not be in the best interests of Commodity Stream, LLC or
    other Clearing Participants, taking into account the size and nature of the positions in question,
    market conditions prevailing at the time, the potential market effects of such liquidating
    transactions as might be directed by Commodity Stream, LLC, and such other circumstances as it
