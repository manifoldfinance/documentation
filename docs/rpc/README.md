## Getting Started

Getting started with Backbone takes just a few minutes once youâ€™ve
[signed up](https://backbonecabal.xyz/register).

When you sign up you'll receive your Backbone v3 key to use within your
app. With it we can provide you with customized insights and analytics,
route your data where it needs to go, and give you access to the most
powerful infrastructure for Ethereum.

## Ethereum API

Seamlessly access Ethereum via the Backbone load-balanced nodes and
smart architecture the same way you would via your own nodes. We have
built services and APIs around
[JSON RPC](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC), REST and
WebSockets that you can use with your favorite libraries and frameworks,
on four Ethereum networks.

## WebSockets API

Use our WebSockets API to poll on filters, subscriptions, events, etc.

[Ethereum Pub/Sub API documentation](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/RPC-PUB-SUB)
