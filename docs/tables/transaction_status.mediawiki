! Status
! style="font-weight:normal;" | Description
|-
| QUEUED
| The default state when initially creating a transaction during the initial API call. This indicates that this transaction is waiting to be picked up by a background worker.
|-
| PROCESSING
| A background worker has started to process this transaction.
|-
| FUNDING
| An auxiliary funding transaction is being initiated (this only applies to non-Ether transactions).
|-
| FUNDED
| An auxiliary funding transaction was successful (this only applies to non-Ether transactions).
|-
| BROADCASTING
| The transaction is being announced to the blockchain network nodes.
|-
| BROADCASTED
| The transaction was successfully announced to the blockchain network nodes.
|-
| PENDING
| The transaction is "pending" / "in the mempool", i.e. known to (some) blockchain network nodes, and awaiting inclusion/mining into a block.
|-
| CONFIRMING
| The transaction was mined into a block, but not enough subsequent blocks have yet been mined to consider that transaction "safe" / confirmed.
|-
| CONFIRMED
| The transaction was mined into a block and enough subsequent blocks have been mined to consider that transaction "safe" / confirmed.
|-
| FAILED
| The transaction was mined into a block, but the execution of its smart contract code failed. Several reasons are possible, most notably "out of gas". The transaction is still included in a block because its gas is still awarded to the miner who attempted to execute it.
|-
| REJECTED
| The transaction was mined into a block but was rejected during the execution of its smart contract code. Several reasons are possible, most notably Solidity's require() assertions not being satisfied. The transaction is still included in a block because it's gas is still awarded to the miner who attempted to execute it.
|-
| UNPROCESSABLE
| An unrecoverable error occurred which prevents us from getting this transaction onto the blockchain. We have given up (or the customer requested us not to retry).
|-
| RETRYING
| A temporary/recoverable error occurred, and this transaction was re-queued as to try getting this transaction onto the blockchain at a later time. This state is more or less equivalent to QUEUED, but its name is more telling.
