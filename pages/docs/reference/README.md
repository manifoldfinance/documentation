# Manifold Finance RPC API

> RPC Overview & Documentation

## Getting Started

Getting started with Backbone takes just a few minutes once you’ve [signed up](#).

When you sign up you'll receive your Backbone v3 key to use within your app. With it we can provide you with customized
insights and analytics, route your data where it needs to go, and give you access to the most powerful infrastructure
for Ethereum. [Learn more about getting started](#), and if
you have any issues check our other resources below for help.

## Ethereum API

Seamlessly access Ethereum via the Backbone load-balanced nodes and smart architecture the same way you would via your
own nodes. We have built services and APIs around [JSON RPC](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC), REST and
WebSockets that you can use with your favorite libraries and frameworks, on four Ethereum networks.

## WebSockets API

Use our WebSockets API to poll on filters, subscriptions, events, etc. Access the
[Ethereum Pub/Sub API documentation](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/RPC-PUB-SUB) and
[Parity Ethereum Pub/Sub API documentation](https://wiki.parity.io/JSONRPC-Parity-Pub-Sub-module.html). Read more about
our [WebSockets API](#).
