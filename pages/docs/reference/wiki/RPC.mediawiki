! Method !! Description !! Considerations
|-
| eth_blockNumber || Returns the number of the most recent block. || 
|-
| eth_call || Immediately executes a new message call without creating a transaction on the blockchain. || eth_call consumes 0 gas, but has a gas parameter for messages that require it.
|-
| eth_chainId || Returns an integer value for the currently configured Chain Id value introduced in EIP-155. Returns None if no Chain Id is available. || 
|-
| eth_estimateGas || Estimates and returns the gas required for a transaction without adding the transaction to the blockchain. || 
|-
| eth_gasPrice || Returns the current price per gas in Wei. || 
|-
| eth_getBalance || Returns the balance of an account for the specified account address and integer position of storage. || 
|-
| eth_getBlockByHash || Returns information about the block specified using the block hash. || 
|-
| eth_getBlockByNumber || Returns information about the block specified using the block number. || 
|-
| eth_getBlockTransactionCountByHash || Returns the number of transactions in the block specified using the block hash. || 
|-
| eth_getBlockTransactionCountByNumber || Returns the number of transactions in the block specified using the block number. || 
|-
| eth_getCode || Returns the code at the specified account address. || 
|-
| eth_getFilterChanges || Polls the specified filter ID, retuning an array of logs that occurred since the last poll. || Filters are ephemeral. If Managed Blockchain needs to manage or maintain node instances for availability and performance, and an instance is replaced, filters may be deleted. We recommend that you write your application code to handle the occasional deletion of filters.
|-
| eth_getFilterLogs || Returns an array of all logs for the specified filter ID. || Filters are ephemeral. If Managed Blockchain needs to manage or maintain node instances for availability and performance, and an instance is replaced, filters may be deleted. We recommend that you write your application code to handle the occasional deletion of filters.
|-
| eth_getLogs || Returns an array of all logs for a specified filter object. || Filters are ephemeral. If Managed Blockchain needs to manage or maintain node instances for availability and performance, and an instance is replaced, filters may be deleted. We recommend that you write your application code to handle the occasional deletion of filters.
|-
| eth_getProof || Experimental – Returns the account and storage values of the specified account, including the Merkle proof. || 
|-
| eth_getStorageAt || Returns the value of the specified storage position for the specified account address. || 
|-
| eth_getTransactionByBlockHashAndIndex || Returns information about a transaction using the specified block hash and transaction index position. || 
|-
| eth_getTransactionByBlockNumberAndIndex || Returns information about a transaction using the specified block number and transaction index position. || 
|-
| eth_getTransactionByHash || Returns information about the transaction with the specified transaction hash. || 
|-
| eth_getTransactionCount || Returns the number of transactions sent from the specified address. || 
|-
| eth_getTransactionReceipt || Returns the receipt of the transaction using the specified transaction hash. || 
|-
| eth_getUncleByBlockHashAndIndex || Returns information about the uncle block specified using the block hash and uncle index position. || 
|-
| eth_getUncleByBlockNumberAndIndex || Returns information about the uncle block specified using the block number and uncle index position. || 
|-
| eth_getUncleCountByBlockHash || Returns the number of counts in the uncle specified using the uncle hash. || 
|-
| eth_getUncleCountByBlockNumber || Returns the number of counts in the uncle specified using the uncle number. || 
|-
| eth_getWork || Returns the hash of the current block, the seedHash, and the boundary condition (also called the "target") to be met. || 
|-
| eth_newBlockFilter || Creates a filter in the node to notify when a new block arrives. Use <code>eth_getFilterChanges</code> to check for state changes. || 
|-
| eth_newFilter || Creates a filter object with the specified filter options (such as from block, to block, contract address, or topics). || 
|-
| eth_newPendingTransactionFilter || Creates a filter in the node to notify when new pending transactions arrive. Use <code>eth_getFilterChanges</code> to check for state changes. || 
|-
| eth_protocolVersion || Returns the current Ethereum protocol version. || 
|-
| eth_sendRawTransaction || Creates a new message call transaction or a contract creation for signed transactions. || Managed Blockchain supports raw transactions only. You must create and sign transactions before sending them. For more information, see How to create raw transactions in Ethereum.
|-
| eth_subscribe || Experimental for publication subscription – Creates a subscription for specified events and returns a subscription ID. || Available only when using WebSockets. Subscriptions are coupled to each connection. When the connection closes, the subscription is removed.
|-
| eth_syncing || Returns an object with sync status data or false when not syncing. || 
|-
| eth_uninstallFilter || Uninstalls the filter with the specified filter ID. || 
|-
| eth_unsubscribe || Experimental for publication subscription – Cancels the subscription with the specified subscription ID. || 
|-
| net_listening || Returns true if the client is actively listening for network connections. || 
|-
| net_peerCount || Returns the number of peers currently connected to the client. || 
|-
| net_version || Returns the current network ID. || 
|-
| txpool_inspect || Lists a textual summary of all transactions currently pending inclusion in the next blocks, and those that are queued (being scheduled for future execution only). || 
|-
| txpool_status || Provides a count of all transactions currently pending inclusion in the next blocks, and those that are queued (being scheduled for future execution only). || 
|-
| web3_clientVersion || Returns the current client version. || 
|-
| web3_sha3 || Returns Keccak-256 (not the standardized SHA3-256) of the given data. ||
