CONFIRMING The transaction was mined into a block, but not enough subsequent blocks have yet been mined to consider that transaction \"safe\" / confirmed.   CONFIRMED The transaction was mined into a block and enough subsequent blocks have been mined to consider that transaction \"safe\" / confirmed.   FAILED The transaction was mined into a block, but the execution of its smart contract code failed. Several reasons are possible, most notably \"out of gas\". The transaction is still included in a block because its gas is still awarded to the miner who attempted to execute it.   REJECTED The transaction was mined into a block but was rejected during the execution of its smart contract code. Several reasons are possible, most notably Solidity's require() assertions not being satisfied. The transaction is still included in a block because it's gas is still awarded to the miner who attempted to execute it.   UNPROCESSABLE An unrecoverable error occurred which prevents us from getting this transaction onto the blockchain. We have given up (or the customer requested us not to retry).   RETRYING A temporary/recoverable error occurred, and this transaction was re-queued as to try getting this transaction onto the blockchain at a later time.

The Exchange accepts bids and offers in the form of orders and attempts to match them:</p> <ul> <li>bids are submitted as buy orders;</li> <li>offers are submitted as sell orders.</li> </ul> <p>Exchanges are also known as \"venues\", although Exchanges are not the only kind of trading venue.</p>","title":"Exchanges"},{"location":"limit_order_books/#level-2-order-books","text":"<p>The \"liquidity\" available in the LOB can be viewed in multiple ways. In this article, we present the liquidity in the LOB as a stack of \"price levels\", where each price level comprises one or more orders with the same price and side. This representation is known as a level 2 order book aggregated by price.</p> <p>Consider the following LOB with two price levels:</p>    Level Bid Qty Bid Price Spread Offer Price Offer Qty     1 1 9649 2 9651 1   2 5 9648 5 9653 3    <p>For each given price level:</p> <ul> <li>the quantity is the sum of all order quantities at that level;</li> <li>the \"spread\" is the difference between the bid and offer price.</li> </ul> <p>The first level, or Top Of Book (TOB), shows the best bid and offer available in the order book:</p> <ul> <li>the bids are arranged in descending order with the best bid at the top;</li> <li>the offers are arranged in ascending order with the best offer at the top.</li> </ul>","title":"Level 2 Order Books"},{"location":"limit_order_books/#limit-orders","text":"<p>The LOB gets its name from a standard order type known as a \"limit\" order; a LOB is essentially a book of limit orders.</p> <p>The price on a limit order is known as the limit price. The limit price specifies the worst price at which the trader is willing to trade (highest for bids and lowest for offers). This article deals exclusively with limit orders, so the limit price is subsequently referred to simply as the price.</p>","title":"Limit Orders"},{"location":"limit_order_books/#resting-orders","text":"<p>A trade happens when a buy or sell order is matched with one or more pre-existing orders in the LOB. How an order behaves when it is not immediately filled varies between order types.</p> <p>Limit orders may also specify how long they are \"good for\". If a limit order is good for a period of time, and it is not immediately filled, then it is placed in the LOB according to its side (buy or sell) and price. An unmatched limit order that is live or \"working\" in the LOB is known as a \"resting\" order. Order types that cannot rest in the order book are either immediately filled or cancelled.</p> <p>The short-hand notation below will be used in proceeding examples to describe a limit order:</p> <p>BUY 2@9650 : a buy order where 2 is the order quantity and 9650 is the price.</p> <p>If this limit order is applied to our earlier example, then it will rest at the TOB on the bid side, because its price is better than the current TOB:</p>    Level Bid Qty Bid Price Spread Offer Price Offer Qty     1 2 9650 1 9651 1   2 1 9649 4 9653 3   3 5 9648       <p>Similarly, a limit order to \"SELL 3@9653\" will \"join\" the second level on the offer side:</p>    Level Bid Qty Bid Price Spread Offer Price Offer Qty     1 2 9650 1 9651 1   2 1 9649 4 9653 6   3 5 9648       <p>Note that the number of orders at each price level cannot be derived from the aggregate quantity.

This means that orders are matched first by price, and then by time (order age). If multiple orders exist at the same price level, for example, then the oldest order will be matched first.</p> <p>Consider the effect of a limit order to \"BUY 2@9652\" that crosses the spread:</p>    Level Bid Qty Bid Price Spread Offer Price Offer Qty     1 1 9652 2 9653 6   2 2 9650      3 1 9649      4 5 9648       <p>In this example, the limit order to \"BUY 2@9652\" crossed with the first level on the offer side (\"OFFER 1@9651\"). The price on the order was higher than the level it crossed, so the resulting trade will have an improved price of 9651.</p> <p>The limit order was not completely filled, because there was insufficient quantity on the offer side. And assuming this order is good for some time, any quantity remaining after the matching phase is complete will rest on the bid side, hence the new price level on the bid side at TOB.</p> <p>Orders that cross the spread and \"take\" liquidity from the order book are known as an \"aggressive\" orders. By contrast, orders that do not cross the spread are known as \"passive\" orders.</p> <p>Aggressive orders may \"sweep\" through multiple price levels, as demonstrated in the following example, where an aggressive order to \"SELL 4@9649\" sweeps through the top three levels of the bid side:</p>    Level Bid Qty Bid Price Spread Offer Price Offer Qty     4 5 9648 5 9653 6    <p>This aggressive order will result in the following trades:</p> <ol> <li>1@9652</li> <li>2@9650</li> <li>1@9649</li> </ol>","title":"Order Matching"},{"location":"limit_order_books/#makers-and-takers","text":"<p>Traders that submit aggressive orders are known as \"takers\".

These orders can be classified both in terms of a buyer and a seller or a maker and a taker.

In the first section we will formalize this as the market for transaction inclusion, and distinguish it from the recently emerged separate market of transaction ordering (\u00e0 la flashbots).</p> <p>We will then have a look at this market, developing a simple model for it as a fixed-supply iterated first-price auction.</p> <p>Finally, we will have a closer look at the kinds of miner revenue identified in that model, and examine in what way those can be considered forms of miner extractable value (MEV).</p>","title":"The Status Quo"},{"location":"txprice/informative-1559/#distinction-between-markets-for-inclusion-and-ordering","text":"<p>Like most blockchains Ethereum has a fee payment system directly built into the protocol. First, every transaction specifies a price per gas it is willing to pay. Then, when added into a block, the sending account is charged for the total cost of transaction execution, i.e. <code>total_fee = gas_price * gas_consumed</code>. Users send a fee with their transactions to incentivize miners to include those transactions into a block, which thus creates a market for transaction inclusion.</p> <p>Starting a few years ago, specialized use case patterns emerged that necessitated control not only over general inclusion of transactions, but over their precise position within a block. The most prominent example of this is front-running, where a user targets another user 's in-flight transaction, aiming to have their transaction included right before the target one. By setting up the chain state in a precise and use case specific way (e.g. move an exchange market in a desired direction), the user can then profit off their knowledge of the subsequent transaction 's effect.</p> <p>Initially, these ordering-specific use cases relied solely on the same built-in transaction fee mechanism, as miner sorting algorithms are generally predictable and thus can be influenced with some success. However, with the space getting progressively more competitive, this soon led to considerable amounts of wasted fees for transactions in the incorrect block position. Flashbots was started as an intermediary service between users and miners to address this problem and create a proper market for transaction ordering. This market is mostly independent of the one for transaction inclusion and is barely touched by the changes introduced in EIP-1559. We will thus in the following limit our focus on the market for transaction inclusion. We will also for simplicity ignore any residual ordering-related activity still being facilitated via the native transaction fee mechanism.</p> <p>Note also that the term \"miner extractable value \"(MEV) was coined to refer to value accruing to miners based on their control over secondary aspects of block creation such as transaction ordering. In the following we will explore how the more traditional miner revenue for transaction inclusion can also be considered to be a form of MEV. However, this is not a common use of the terminology and is thus best understood as a thought experiment limited to the context of this writeup.</p>","title":"Distinction between Markets for Inclusion and Ordering"},{"location":"txprice/informative-1559/#fixed-supply-iterated-first-price-auction","text":"<p>To understand the nature of the market for transaction inclusion, it is useful to look at a diagram of the relevant supply and demand curves:</p> <p> Diagram of the pre-1559 short-term supply and demand curves of the transaction inclusion market, in the case of full blocks. Note that this diagram includes multiple simplifications as a tradeoff between accuracy and legibility. Note also that if you aren 't used to the concept of supply &amp;demand curves and how to interpret such diagrams, it might be useful to stop for a bit and try to really understand what you are looking at (including the following sections for context), as most of the remaining writeup is directly based on it.</p> <p>The somewhat unusual shape of this diagram is my attempt of illustrating the particularities of the blockchain context.

Consequently, the \"supply for block space \"(i.e. the amount of transactions miners are willing to include into a block) is fixed at that limit. This is illustrated by the vertical part of the supply curve in the diagram.</p> <p>As a nuance, transaction inclusion is not entirely free for miners. In particular, adding transactions makes the overall block bigger and thus slower to propagate through the network, in turn slightly increasing the uncle risk for the miner. For that reasons, miners usually set a minimum gas price (geth defaults to 1 Gwei) and reject transactions below that threshold, even if this leads to non-full blocks. Consequently, the supply curve has a horizontal part at the bottom, slightly above 0.</p>","title":"Fixed-Supply"},{"location":"txprice/informative-1559/#first-price","text":"<p>The demand side of the market consist of the payment willingness of users as revealed by the gas prices of their transactions and follows a typical demand curve (labeled \"revealed demand \"in the diagram - for \"true demand \"see next section). Its intersection with the supply curve indicates the market clearing gas price for transaction inclusion (indicated as the dashed horizontal line).</p> <p>Under the current system, transactions have to pay the full gas price they specify, even if it is above that market clearing value.

Furthermore, market clearing prices of prior blocks give a rough indication of the required gas price for inclusion.</p> <p>For these reasons, many users don 't initially set the gas price to their maximum payment willingness. This leads to a gap between the observed (revealed) demand and the theoretical true demand.

So the \"product \"of the two indicates the total eth paid in tx fees to the miner.)</p> <p>In our case we have perfect price discrimination, so both areas under the curve (cyan and purple) represent miner surplus.

As laid out by Vitalik, the motivation was to turn the first-price auction system into a uniform-price one (or at least make as much headway as possible to that end). In other words, the goal was to remove or minimize the \"first-price MEV \"(the cyan area) in our first diagram.</p>","title":"Motivation"},{"location":"txprice/informative-1559/#design","text":"<p>To facilitate this goal, some sort of in-protocol oracle for the market clearing inclusion price was necessary. The proposed mechanism was to enshrine a minimum gas price (called base fee) into the protocol. Simultaneously, the maximum block size would be doubled, using a simple proportional controller for the base fee to target 50% filled blocks. Simply put: Because most blocks would now no longer be completely full (with not enough transactions willing to pay the base fee), the size of a block can be used as an indication for whether (and how much) the current base fee level is too high or too low, relative to the \"ideal fee level \"that would lead to exactly 50% filled blocks. The base fee could then be adjusted appropriately, and its current level used as the desired price oracle.</p> <p>Note that this mechanism is only possible due to the fact that the primary bottleneck for the Ethereum block size is the long-term cost imposed by transactions (i.e. mostly state growth). While there are also short-term limiting factors for block size (such as propagation and verification time), those are more forgiving and thus allow for this 2x increase of the maximum block size. This is also the reason for the higher throughput of chains like the Binance Smart Chain that only optimize for short-term throughput, without concern about long-term effects.</p> <p>With this price oracle, we can now turn the first-price auction system into a uniform-price one, by only charging transactions the base fee. As this makes the base fee a possible target for miner manipulation, it turns out that it is important to no longer have the base fee payment go directly to them, as they could otherwise add extra transactions to their blocks for free, distorting the base fee adjustment signal (see Vitalik 's post for details). As the base fee is legible by the protocol, this can easily be avoided by collecting the base fee from users directly, but not forwarding it to the miner. This effectively turns these payments into direct protocol revenue (the first of its kind for Ethereum!). See the section below for further discussion.</p> <p>While the mechanism as described almost works, it lacks one important piece: An incentive for miners to include transactions at all. As they don 't receive the base fee payment, they lack the cost offset from our earlier model. So for the final version of EIP-1559, a new fee type (the priority fee) is added to transactions, with a first-price auction reinstated for that fee part only. Given that the minimum priority fee is fairly small and well understood, this small regression back to a first-price system is however of limited significance.</p>","title":"Design"},{"location":"txprice/informative-1559/#fee-market-model","text":"<p>With all the elements of the EIP in place, we can now construct an updated fee market model:</p> <p></p> <p>Diagram of the post-1559 short-term supply and demand curves of the transaction inclusion market, for the case of a non-full (but slightly over the \u00bd target) block.</p> <p>The main changes in comparison to the original diagram come from the introduction of the base fee, the doubling of the block size limit, and the new effective gas price payment method.</p>","title":"Fee Market Model"},{"location":"txprice/informative-1559/#base-fee","text":"<p>The base fee now acts as a price floor, with miner revenue only applied on top.

And all nodes, when reaching the maximum mempool capacity, want to get the transactions with the lowest inclusion chance, that they can evict to make room for more promising transactions. Both of these problems consist of two sub-problems: The choice of a comparison metric and the choice of an efficient data structure for transactions, based on that metric.</p> <p>For current (legacy) transactions, both the high-end sorting for mining and the low-end sorting for eviction rely on the <code>gas_price</code> transaction field as their comparison metric. This in turn also leads to the same choice of data structure, namely a (partially-sorted) max-heap for mining and a (partially-sorted) min-heap for eviction.</p> <p>For EIP-1559 transactions, the situation is more complex. For mining, the relevant metric is the current effective transaction tip, i.e. the amount per gas the transaction is willing to pay to the miner for inclusion. For eviction however, this is not the correct metric to use. As the effective transaction tip depends on the current protocol <code>base_fee</code>, the relative order of transaction changes over time and is not an accurate heuristic for inclusion chance. Thus, a more elaborate metric, ideally close to \"estimated average future effective transaction tip \", is necessary.</p> <p>The change in metrics also requires different data structures for EIP-1559 transaction sorting. For mining, a solution based on a slightly more complex heap-approach is in the process of being prototyped. For eviction, the choice of data structure depends on the choice of metric. In particular, this imposes an additional constraint on the choice of metric: Find a metric that is accurate enough under a vast variety of <code>base_fee</code> regimes, while also being efficiently implementable.</p> <p>The third sorting-related problem mentioned by Tim is that of transaction replacement (for transactions with the same sender and nonce). It is similar to that of eviction, with an added focus on DOS protection and predicatability.
