### SushiSwap

The SushiSwap integration provides a service that realizes profit by transaction
batching for the purposes of arbitrage by controlling transaction ordering.

Right now every user sends a transaction directly to the network mempool and
thus give away the arbitrage, front-running, back-running opportunities to
miners(or random bots).

OpenMEV provides a credibly neutral platform that enables aggregation of
transactions (batching) for the purposes of extracting MEV profits and returning
them back to the traders.

### What is `credible neutrality`?

This ethos is at the heart of OpenMEV. Part of establishing credible neutrality
is having a clear and comprehensive rule book that regulates off-chain behavior
and activities. Our assumption concerning governance is that methods and
processes that work in legacy markets may not be applicable in adversarial
environments such as permissionless blockchains. With that understanding it is
important not to rely solely on such systems and mechanics long term.
